## Architecture Terms

### ONEX (OmniNode Execution System)

The distributed orchestration platform that provides event-driven workflow execution, protocol-first design, and enterprise-grade service coordination. ONEX follows a layered architecture with clear separation between contracts (SPI), models (Core), and implementations (Infra).

See: [Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md)

### SPI (Service Provider Interface)

The Service Provider Interface package (`omnibase_spi`) that defines protocol-based contracts for the ONEX platform. SPI contains only Python `Protocol` definitions and exceptions with zero implementation dependencies. Implementations live in `omnibase_infra`.

See: [README.md](./README.md)

### 4-Node Architecture

The fundamental ONEX pattern where all processing is categorized into four distinct node types: **Compute**, **Effect**, **Reducer**, and **Orchestrator**. Each node type has specific responsibilities and constraints regarding side effects and determinism.

| Node Type | Purpose | Side Effects | Deterministic |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Compute | Pure transformations | No | Yes |
| Effect | I/O operations | Yes | No |
| Reducer | State aggregation | Controlled | Varies |
| Orchestrator | Workflow coordination | Delegates | N/A |

See: [NODES.md - Architecture](./api-reference/NODES.md#architecture)

### Protocol-First Design

The design philosophy where all services are defined through Python `Protocol` interfaces before any implementation is created. This ensures loose coupling, testability, and clear contract boundaries.

See: [Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md)

---

## Protocol Terms

### Protocol (Python typing.Protocol)

A Python `typing.Protocol` that defines structural subtyping (duck typing with type safety). Protocols specify method signatures and properties that implementations must provide without requiring explicit inheritance.

```python
from typing import Protocol

class ProtocolExample(Protocol):
    def method(self) -> str:
        ...  # Ellipsis indicates abstract method
```

See: [Python typing.Protocol documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol)

### @runtime_checkable

A decorator from `typing` that enables `isinstance()` checks against a Protocol at runtime. All SPI protocols must be decorated with `@runtime_checkable` to support runtime type validation.

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable

@runtime_checkable
class ProtocolHandler(Protocol):
    @property
    def handler_type(self) -> str: ...
```

See: [HANDLERS.md - Protocol Definition](./api-reference/HANDLERS.md#protocol-definition)

### Duck Typing

A programming concept where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of methods and properties rather than its explicit type. Python's Protocol system provides type-safe duck typing through structural subtyping.

### Structural Typing

A type system where type compatibility is determined by the structure (methods and properties) of types rather than explicit declarations or inheritance. Python Protocols implement structural typing.

### Protocol Compliance

The state where an implementation correctly satisfies all requirements of a Protocol including method signatures, property types, return types, and semantic contracts. Use `isinstance()` with `@runtime_checkable` protocols to verify compliance at runtime.

```python
# Verify an object implements ProtocolHandler
if isinstance(handler, ProtocolHandler):
    result = await handler.execute(request, config)
```

---

## SPI-Specific Terms

### Namespace Isolation

The architectural rule that SPI must never import from `omnibase_infra` (implementation package). SPI may import from `omnibase_core` for type definitions. This ensures clean dependency boundaries.

```text
Allowed:     SPI → Core
Forbidden:   SPI → Infra
Forbidden:   Core → SPI
```

See: [CLAUDE.md - Architecture](../CLAUDE.md)

### Contract

A declarative specification (typically YAML) that defines behaviors, state machines, or workflows. Contracts are compiled at build-time by Contract Compilers into runtime models that nodes use for execution.

**Contract Types**:
- **Effect Contract**: Defines side-effecting operations (API calls, DB queries)
- **Workflow Contract**: Defines multi-step orchestration flows
- **FSM Contract**: Defines finite state machine configurations

See: [CONTRACTS.md](./api-reference/CONTRACTS.md)

### Contract Compiler

A build-time tool that compiles YAML contract files into runtime contract models. Compilers validate contract structure and semantic correctness before generating optimized runtime representations.

See: [CONTRACTS.md - Architecture](./api-reference/CONTRACTS.md#architecture)

### Handler Lifecycle

The state progression of a handler from creation through operation to cleanup: **Created** → **Initialized** → **Closed**. Handlers must be initialized before execution and properly shut down to release resources.

```python
handler = HttpRestHandler()
await handler.initialize(config)  # Created → Initialized
try:
    await handler.execute(request, config)  # Operations
finally:
    await handler.shutdown()  # Initialized → Closed
```

See: [HANDLERS.md - Lifecycle Diagram](./api-reference/HANDLERS.md#lifecycle-diagram)

### Handler Registry

A service locator pattern (`ProtocolHandlerRegistry`) that manages the mapping between protocol type identifiers (e.g., `"http"`, `"kafka"`) and their handler implementations. Enables dependency injection of handlers into effect nodes.

See: [REGISTRY.md](./api-reference/REGISTRY.md)

---

## Integration Terms

### omnibase_core

The core models package that contains Pydantic models, enums, and runtime type definitions shared across ONEX packages. SPI protocols reference Core models for type hints.

**Contains**: `ModelComputeInput`, `ModelEffectOutput`, `ModelConnectionConfig`, etc.

See: [CLAUDE.md - Architecture](../CLAUDE.md)

### omnibase_infra

The infrastructure package that contains concrete implementations of SPI protocols. Infra depends on both SPI (contracts) and Core (models).

**Contains**: `HttpRestHandler`, `KafkaHandler`, `PostgresHandler`, etc.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The Model Context Protocol integration for multi-subsystem tool coordination. MCP protocols provide tool registry, load balancing, health monitoring, and execution tracking across distributed systems.

See: [MCP.md](./api-reference/MCP.md)

### FSM (Finite State Machine)

A computational model used for workflow state management in ONEX. FSM contracts define states, transitions, guards, and actions for managing lifecycle workflows (e.g., order processing, document approval).

**FSM States Example**: `pending` → `running` → `completed`

See: [CONTRACTS.md - ProtocolFSMContractCompiler](./api-reference/CONTRACTS.md#protocolfsmcontractcompiler)

### Event Bus

The distributed messaging infrastructure that provides publish/subscribe patterns, event serialization, and dead letter queue handling. Supports multiple backend adapters including Kafka, Redpanda, and in-memory implementations.

See: [EVENT-BUS.md](./api-reference/EVENT-BUS.md)

### Event Sourcing

An architectural pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of events with sequence numbers and causation tracking. ONEX workflows use event sourcing for audit trails, replay capabilities, and real-time projections.

See: [WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION.md](./api-reference/WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION.md)

---

## Node Terms

### Compute Node

A node type (`ProtocolComputeNode`) that performs pure, deterministic transformations with no side effects. The same input always produces the same output. Suitable for data transformation, validation, and algorithm execution.

**Key Properties**:
- No I/O operations
- Deterministic output
- Safe to retry without side effects
- Uses `ModelComputeInput` / `ModelComputeOutput`

See: [NODES.md - ProtocolComputeNode](./api-reference/NODES.md#protocolcomputenode)

### Effect Node

A node type (`ProtocolEffectNode`) that performs side-effecting I/O operations such as API calls, database queries, and file operations. Effect nodes have lifecycle management (initialize/shutdown) and may be non-deterministic.

**Key Properties**:
- Has side effects (I/O)
- Requires lifecycle management
- May not be deterministic
- Often delegates to `ProtocolHandler`
- Uses `ModelEffectInput` / `ModelEffectOutput`

See: [NODES.md - ProtocolEffectNode](./api-reference/NODES.md#protocoleffectnode)

### Reducer Node

A node type (`ProtocolReducerNode`) that aggregates state from a stream of inputs. Reducers maintain accumulated state across invocations and produce aggregated outputs. Used for metrics collection, event aggregation, and state accumulation.

**Key Properties**:
- Maintains accumulated state
- Processes streams of inputs
- Produces reduced/aggregated outputs
- Uses `ModelReductionInput` / `ModelReductionOutput`

See: [NODES.md - ProtocolReducerNode](./api-reference/NODES.md#protocolreducernode)

### Orchestrator Node

A node type (`ProtocolOrchestratorNode`) that coordinates the execution of other nodes or workflows. Orchestrators manage complex multi-step processes, handle error recovery, and implement compensation logic.

**Key Properties**:
- Coordinates multiple nodes
- Manages workflow state
- Handles partial failures
- May implement saga patterns
- Uses `ModelOrchestrationInput` / `ModelOrchestrationOutput`

See: [NODES.md - ProtocolOrchestratorNode](./api-reference/NODES.md#protocolorchestratornode)

---

## Handler Terms

### Handler

A protocol-specific I/O adapter (`ProtocolHandler`) that encapsulates communication with external systems. Handlers provide a consistent interface for effect nodes to perform operations like HTTP requests, database queries, or message publishing.

**Handler Types**: `http`, `kafka`, `postgresql`, `neo4j`, `redis`, `grpc`, `websocket`, `file`, `memory`

See: [HANDLERS.md](./api-reference/HANDLERS.md)

### Effect (Side Effect)

Any operation that interacts with the external world or modifies state outside the current function scope. Examples include file I/O, network requests, database operations, and logging. In ONEX, side effects are isolated to Effect Nodes and Handlers.

### Handler Type

A string identifier that categorizes a handler's protocol (e.g., `"http"`, `"kafka"`, `"postgresql"`). Handler types are used for registry lookups, metrics collection, and routing.

---

## Container Terms

### Dependency Injection

A design pattern where components receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. ONEX uses `ProtocolServiceRegistry` for enterprise-grade dependency injection with lifecycle management.

See: [CONTAINER.md](./api-reference/CONTAINER.md)

### Service Lifecycle

The lifetime pattern for service instances managed by the container. ONEX supports multiple lifecycle patterns:

| Lifecycle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `singleton` | Single instance shared across all requests |
| `transient` | New instance created for each resolution |
| `scoped` | Instance per scope (request, session, thread) |
| `pooled` | Fixed pool of instances for performance |
| `lazy` | Created on first use |
| `eager` | Created at startup |

See: [CONTAINER.md - Lifecycle Management](./api-reference/CONTAINER.md#lifecycle-management)

### Injection Scope

The boundary within which scoped instances are shared. ONEX supports: `request`, `session`, `thread`, `process`, `global`, and `custom` scopes.

### Circular Dependency

A situation where two or more services depend on each other, creating a cycle that prevents resolution. ONEX's `ProtocolServiceRegistry` automatically detects and prevents circular dependencies.

See: [CONTAINER.md - Circular Dependency Detection](./api-reference/CONTAINER.md#circular-dependency-detection)

---

## Event Bus Terms

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

A holding queue for messages that cannot be successfully processed after exhausting retry attempts. The `ProtocolDLQHandler` provides monitoring, metrics, and reprocessing capabilities for DLQ messages.

See: [EVENT-BUS.md - Dead Letter Queue Handler](./api-reference/EVENT-BUS.md#dead-letter-queue-handler-protocol)

### Event Envelope

A generic wrapper (`ProtocolEventEnvelope`) for event payloads that provides metadata and breaks circular dependencies in event processing systems.

See: [EVENT-BUS.md - Event Envelope Protocol](./api-reference/EVENT-BUS.md#event-envelope-protocol)

### Correlation ID

A unique identifier (UUID) that tracks a request or workflow across multiple services and events. Used for distributed tracing and debugging.

### Causation ID

A unique identifier that links an event to the event that caused it. Combined with correlation IDs, enables full event causation tracking and replay.

### Schema Registry

A service (`ProtocolSchemaRegistry`) that manages schema versions for event validation. Supports JSON Schema, Avro, and Protobuf formats with compatibility checking.

See: [EVENT-BUS.md - Schema Registry Protocol](./api-reference/EVENT-BUS.md#schema-registry-protocol)
