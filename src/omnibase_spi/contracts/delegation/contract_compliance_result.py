"""ContractComplianceResult -- quality gate outcome for delegation responses.

Captures the outcome of a quality-gate evaluation applied to a delegated
response.  Used by :class:`ContractDelegatedResponse` to attach compliance
metadata alongside the rendered output.

This contract must NOT import from omnibase_core, omnibase_infra, or omniclaude.

    """Outcome of a quality-gate evaluation on a delegation response.

    Note:
        ``passed`` is the boolean summary and ``verdict`` provides the full
        qualitative result.  These fields are intentionally independent so that
        producers can express nuanced outcomes (e.g. ``passed=True`` with
        ``verdict='WARN'``).  Consumers should treat ``passed`` as
        authoritative for boolean checks and ``verdict`` for detailed
        assessment.  Cross-field consistency validation is deferred to
        consumers.

    Attributes:
        schema_version: Wire-format version for forward compatibility.
        passed: Whether the quality gate passed.
        gate_name: Name of the quality gate that was evaluated.
        score: Numeric quality score (0.0-1.0).
        threshold: Minimum score required to pass.
        verdict: Categorical verdict of the evaluation.
        violations: List of violation descriptions if the gate failed.
        evaluated_at_iso: ISO-8601 timestamp of the evaluation.
            Format validation is deferred to consumers.
        extensions: Escape hatch for forward-compatible extension data.
