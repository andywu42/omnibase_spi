"""ContractProjectionResult -- result wire format for projection writes.

Represents the outcome of a synchronous projection write operation
as returned by ``ProtocolNodeProjectionEffect.execute()``.

This module MUST NOT import from omnibase_core, omnibase_infra, or
omniclaude.  It contains only wire-format data; all business logic lives
in the runtime layer.

Architecture Context:
    ``ProtocolNodeProjectionEffect.execute()`` writes a projection to the
    persistence layer synchronously before returning to the ONEX runtime.
    The runtime inspects this contract to determine whether to proceed
    with the Kafka publish:

    - ``success=True``: projection persisted; runtime publishes to Kafka.
    - ``success=False``: no-op (e.g. sequence already applied); skip publish.
    - Failure: ``execute()`` raises ``ProjectorError`` — it NEVER returns
      ``success=False`` for infrastructure failures.

Related:
    - internal issue: ProtocolNodeProjectionEffect as synchronous ProtocolEffect
    - internal issue: ModelProjectionIntent (input side of the same boundary)
    - omnibase_spi.exceptions.ProjectorError: raised on persistence failure

class ContractProjectionResult(BaseModel):
    """Wire-format result of a synchronous projection write operation.

    Returned by ``ProtocolNodeProjectionEffect.execute()`` when the write
    completes without raising an exception.

    Design Principles:
        - **Frozen**: Instances are immutable after construction.
        - **Raise on failure**: Infrastructure failures are signalled via
          ``ProjectorError``, not via a ``success=False`` result.  The
          ``success`` field is reserved for non-error no-op writes (e.g.
          idempotent sequence-already-applied skips).
        - **Minimal surface**: Only the fields strictly required by the
          runtime are included here.

    Attributes:
        success: ``True`` when the projection was written (or idempotently
            accepted) without error.  ``False`` for valid no-op writes.
        artifact_ref: Opaque reference to the persisted projection artifact.
            Format is implementation-defined (e.g. a database primary key,
            an S3 object key, or a content-addressable hash).  ``None``
            when ``success`` is ``False`` or when the implementation does
            not assign a stable reference.
        error: Human-readable description of the problem when ``success``
            is ``False`` and no exception was raised.  ``None`` on success.

    Example -- success::

        result = effect.execute(intent)
        assert result.success
        publish_to_kafka(result.artifact_ref)

    Example -- idempotent skip (no-op, not an error)::

        result = ContractProjectionResult(
            success=False,
            artifact_ref=None,
            error="Sequence already applied; skipped.",
        )

    Note:
        ``ProtocolNodeProjectionEffect.execute()`` MUST raise
        ``ProjectorError`` on infrastructure failure.  Returning
        ``success=False`` is reserved for semantically valid non-writes.
